<!-- Useful model here: https://affcom.ku.edu/ -->
<!-- But, would like to display multiple authors - and be able to link to specific people? -->
<!-- https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1324#issuecomment-1252961320 -->

<!-- TODO: Author(s) filed not displaying correctly (currently reads "Author", not "Author(s)") on page. -->
<!-- Add rest of research from myself and coauthors to this page. -->
<!-- At some point it would be nice to automate conversion from a .bib files into the YAML header required by Quarto's listings format. But we're not quite there yet: the current listings isn't set up to deal with multiple authors or family names. So we'd need to write a custom listings (https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings-custom.html) to deal with this. Possible but a bit of a headache, particularly for the multiple authors thing. -->
<!-- It's also unclear how I change what metadata actually gets shown on a page. Right now that seems fixed, so we'd need to figure that out. -->
<!-- Related to the above, would like to include links in the metadata. -->
