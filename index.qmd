title: "UBC Environmental Data Science Lab"
---

The UBC Environmental Data Science Lab (EDSL) is a collegial research group based out of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

## Projects

Our projects ask how people impact the environment, how the environment impacts people, and how better policies and healthy markets can improve the interaction of the two. We (do our best to) answer these questions using the tools of applied economics and data science.

## Mission

The mission of the lab is to provide a community and a shared set of resources for researchers UBC whose work seeks to understand how people and the environment interact.

<!-- TODO -->
<!-- - Better/catchier one word name? -->
<!-- - Include links to papers easily in metadata. -->
<!-- - More generally, how can I put the YAML metadata into the header of documents. Most things seem to be hardcoded in. -->
<!-- - Add more detail on other collaborators. -->
<!-- - Add more detail on papers. How can we convert from a bib? -->
<!--   - Seems relevant: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/create-citeable-articles.html -->
