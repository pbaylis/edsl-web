The UBC Environmental Data Science Lab (EDSL) is a collegial research group based out of the University of British Columbia. 

Our projects ask how climate and related environmental hazards impact people, and how people can better respond to them. 

We (do our best to) answer these questions using the tools of applied economics and data science.

## Mission

The first mission of the group is to provide a community and a shared set of resources for community members UBC interested in questions about how people and the environment interact.

The second mission is to more precisely define the first mission. 

(It's a work in progress y'all.)
